These are scripts for Masstagger component (foo_masstag) which can be 
imported at their 'Manage Scripts' panel.

The names are self explanatory and may come handy to other people too. Some 
of them are meant to be used by custom buttons at any bar to apply the 
script directly to the selected items for easy tagging during playback.
That applies for example to moods, instrumental tracks, etc. Others are 
meant to be applied to the entire library.

Loading them into Masstagger allows to see their actions anyway, so that 
should tell you what they do too, along a preview of the changes.
