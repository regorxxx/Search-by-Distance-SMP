Themes are 'tag containers' which emulate track's tags, to be used with 'search_bydistance' buttons and tools instead of evaluating with a selected track.

Recipes are 'variables containers' which emulate the input of 'search_bydistance' buttons and tools instead of using hardcoded variables or properties.
Recipes may also contain a forced theme, either the entire object or a link to a theme file (path or filename).

Both may be used in buttons, tools or with Playlist Tools's Pools (pools' themes and recipes arguments may link to these files).
