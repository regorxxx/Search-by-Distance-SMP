TF scripts for foobar2000's UI, both CUI and DUI versions.

Some of these scripts are meant to be used along the SMP scripts or tags 
usually used by them. For ex. the Camelot Keys script, which allows to
translate standard keys to Camelot notation and display their position
in the scale for easy manual mixing.
