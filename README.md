# Installation:

Copy all files from the zip into YOUR_FOOBAR_PROFILE_PATH\scripts\SMP\xxx-scripts
Any other path WILL NOT work without editing the scripts.
For ex: mine is c:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000\scripts\SMP\xxx-scripts...
For portable installations: .\foobar2000\profile\scripts\SMP\xxx-scripts...
Then load any button script into a SMP panel within foobar (there are buttons bars and independent buttons for the individual scripts and the playlist tools menu). 'buttons_playlist_tools_menu.js' is associated to the tools menu.
