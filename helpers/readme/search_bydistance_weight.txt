Creates intelligent "spotify-like" playlists using high-level data from
tracks similar to the currently selected one according to genre, style,
key, etc. When their score is over 'scoreFilter', then they are included
n the final pool.

WEIGHT presets work by matching genre\style tags (Rock != Hard Rock),
without using complex logics. Therefore they work with arbitrary tag
values.
