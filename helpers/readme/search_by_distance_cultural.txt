Cultural similarity between artists and/or genres (or styles) maybe be
added via query filters or special tags.

Filters: (pre-scoring filters)
--------
	- Artist cultural filter: by same/different continent, region or 
		country than the selected track's artist.
	
	- Genre cultural filter: by same/different continent or region than
		the selected track's genre/styles. Note a genre may be 
		associated to multiple regions, contrary to artists.

Special Tags: (tags and weighting)
-------------
	- Artist Region: uses the selected track's artist as reference, and
		compares it to every artist's country on library according
		to an allowed range. Distance is calculated by same 
		country (0), same region (1), same continent (2) or 
		different continent(4).
	
	- Genre/Style Region: uses the selected track's genre/styles as 
		reference, and compares it to every other track on library
		according to an allowed range. Distance is calculated by 
		same genre (0) or another genre from same region (1), same
		continent (2) or different continent(4).
		
	Note a range of 4 would make values found at a different continent
	to give a score of zero for the given tag, so by default the ranges
	are set to 5. In such case the score (in linear mode) gives a 20%.
		- Same value:		(5 - 0) / 5 = 100%
		- Same region:		(5 - 1) / 5 =  80%
		- Same continent:	(5 - 2) / 5 =  60%
		- Diff. continent:	(5 - 4) / 5 =  20%
	
	A lower range would completely discard farthest values in the map.
	Negative scoring may also be enabled. For ex. range equal to 3:
		- Same value:		(3 - 0) / 3 = 100%
		- Same region:		(3 - 1) / 3 =  66%
		- Same continent:	(3 - 2) / 3 =  33%
		- Diff. continent:	(3 - 4) / 3 = -33% (or 0%)
	
	Note there is always a bias towards values within the same
	continent.
