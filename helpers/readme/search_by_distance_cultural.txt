Cultural similarity between artists and/or genres (or styles) maybe be
added via query filters or special tags.

	- Artist cultural filter: by same/different continent, region or 
		country than the selected track's artist.
	
	- Genre cultural filter: by same/different continent or region than
		the selected track's genre/styles. Note a genre may be 
		associated to multiple regions, contrary to artists.

Special Tags: (tags and weighting)

		compares it to every artist's country on library according
		to an allowed range. Distance is calculated by same 
		country (0), same region (1), same continent (2) or 
		different continent(4).
	
	- Genre/Style Region: uses the selected track's genre/styles as 
		reference, and compares it to every other track on library

		same genre (0) or another genre from same region (1), same
		continent (2) or different continent(4).
