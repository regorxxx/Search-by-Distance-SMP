Tool to explore genre/styles within your library; uses the current
selection as reference, although it also allows to manually input
arbitrary words if desired.

It can be used to display general statistics for a given genre/style.
That data may come handy in creating new playlists (for tuning settings
or filters), or to be used along Timeline-SMP (*) or World-Map-SMP (**)

Additionally, there are multiple entries to directly create playlists
from your library based on the selected genre/style and/or cultural
or musical influences.
