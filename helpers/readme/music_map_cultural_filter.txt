Cultural similarity between artists and/or genres (or styles) maybe be
taken into account via query filters, which are applied before scoring
and comparing tracks.

Source:
--------
Country tags (aka LOCALE) are retrieved from 'LOCALE LAST.FM' file tag
or [World-Map-SMP database](https://github.com/regorxxx/World-Map-SMP).

Filters: (pre-scoring filters)
--------
	- Artist cultural filter: by same/different continent, region or 
		country than the selected track's artist.
	
	- Genre cultural filter: by same/different continent or region than
		the selected track's genre/styles. Note a genre may be 
		associated to multiple regions, contrary to artists.
