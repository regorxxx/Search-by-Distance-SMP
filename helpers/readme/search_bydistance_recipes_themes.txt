Themes are 'tag containers' which emulate track's tags, to be used with
'search_bydistance' buttons and tools instead of evaluating with the
selected track.

Recipes are 'variables containers' which emulate the args of 
'search_bydistance' buttons snd tools instead of using hardcoded 
variables or properties.
Note recipes may also contain a forced theme, either the entire object or
a link to a theme file (using its path or filename).

Both may be used in buttons, tools or with Playlist Tools:
	- Pools presets may link to these files in their arguments.
	- Search by GRAPH\WEIGHT\DYNGENRE menu presets may link to these
	files in their arguments to have menus which use the variables
	set on those files instead of harcoded in the menu (working similar
	to custom buttons).
	- Custom buttons may use recipes and themes to tweak their behavior
	(see tooltip).

Theme files may be created using the examples files, buttons or Playlist
tools.
	- When using Playlist Tools there is a menu entry (see
	Configuration\Search by Distance) to use the selected track's tags
	as reference and save them to a json file directly.
	In that case, the tags names put at the properties panel will be 
	used. i.e. you can remap genre to use 'GENRE' and 'ALL MUSIC
	GENRE',	etc.
	- When using custom buttons just use the theme menu 
	(Shift + Left Click). Same comments apply.
	
Both type of files may be set to 'Hidden' (file attribute) to not show them
on the menus, instead of deleting them. Some files meant for internal use
only may be hidden by default.
