Filters the library by a query built according to the genre/styles of the
reference track or theme. This query is built on-the-fly taking into 
consideration which other genres/styles are influences or anti-influences
according to the genre/style graph.

Note distance scoring usually filter anti-influences by design, since they
are further away than other genre/styles. But applying a query ensures 
there are zero tracks with those, no matter the other settings... or that
only influences are retrieved (rock tracks would never output rock tracks
-which are naturally similar-  but their influences!).

Rules:
-------------
- Only works on 'GRAPH' mode.

Filters: (pre-scoring filters)
--------
	- Anti-influences filter: removes any track considered to be
		an anti-influence to the genre/styles of the reference
		track (or theme).
		
	- Conditional anti-influences filter: applies the previous
		filter for specific genre/styles only (found at 
		'style_anti_influences_conditional' on the descriptors).
		For any other genre, the filter is not applied.
		
		For ex. a Jazz track as reference will use it, but a
		Rock track will skip it. Some genres are more sensitive
		to style changes than others; it may be tolerable to get
		a grunge track on a rock playlist, but that situation 
		should be absolutely avoided for Jazz playlists.
	
	- Influences filter: only uses tracks considered to be
		an influence/derivative to the genre/styles of the
		reference track (or theme).
		
		Note there is no distinction between influences (past)
		and derivatives (future), that's taken into account
		with the 'DATE' scoring and/or other query filters.
		For ex., to get influences from the past, use a dynamic
		query to only retrieve influences with a date lower 
		than the current one. There are some filters specific
		for this by default on the settings.
