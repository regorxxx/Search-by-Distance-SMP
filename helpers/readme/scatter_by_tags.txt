Reorders selection to avoid consecutive tracks with the same configurable
tag. Can be used to scatter instrumental tracks, an specific genre, mood,
etc.

Whenever the selection has so many tracks with that tag value, than
scattering them would not allow having at least one different valued
track between them, it's left as is.

The intercalate option tries to avoid consecutive tags with same genre,
style, artist, ... thus not tied to an specific tag value. It the list
have 10 different artists, it tries to reorder the tracks to have those
10 artists on every subset of 10 tracks.

Whenever that's not possible, intercalation is still applied, having
tracks with consecutive same tag at the end. 
For ex (artist): A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, A, A
