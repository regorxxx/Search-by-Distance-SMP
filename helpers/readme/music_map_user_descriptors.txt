Custom genre/styles, substitutions or other variables may be added
to the graph by the user using the existing framework.

Instead of editing the main file, you can add any edit to an user 
configurable file which should be placed at the profile folder on:
'js_data/helpers/music_graph_descriptors_xxx_user.js'. This is done to
ensure the file does not get overwritten when updating the scripts.

Check sample at helpers folder for more info and copy it to that path.
Alternatively the custom button has an entry to open the user descriptors
which may be used to open it. If the file does not exist yet, a copy will
be created and then opened.

It's irrelevant whether you add your changes to the original file or the 
user's one but note on future script updates the main file may be 
updated too and therefore changes would be lost. 

Both the html and foobar scripts will use any setting on the user file 
(as if it were in the main file), so there is no other difference. 
Anything at the docs which points to one of the file applies to the other
[scripts folder] 'helpers/music_graph_descriptors_xxx.js'
[profile folder] 'js_data/helpers/music_graph_descriptors_xxx_user.js'.
