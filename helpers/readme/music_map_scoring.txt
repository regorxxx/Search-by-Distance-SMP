Similarity scoring for genre and style weighting. There are multiple 
scoring methods available, i.e. how tags from a library track are 
compared against a reference track to retrieve similarity:

	- LINEAR: simple proportion, i.e. if 3/4 tags match, then its
		similarity score will be 75%. Thus being always "linear" 
		no matter the tag count.
	- LOGARITHMIC: uses a logarithmic curve to map linear scoring to a
		curve. Little sensitivity to tag values counts (n). i.e. if
		75% of values match, then it will output a score near 80%
		for all tag counts (n).
	- LOGISTIC: uses the logistic curve to map linear scoring. High
		sensitivity to tag values counts (n). i.e. if 75% of values
		match, then it will output a score from ~80% to ~95% 
		depending on tag counts (n).
	- NORMAL: uses the cumulative distribution function of a normal
		distribution to map linear scoring. Medium sensitivity to
		tag values counts (n). i.e. if 50% of values match, then it
		will output a score from ~70% to ~90% depending on tag
		counts (n). S-shaped, giving more weight to high scores.

'LOGARITHMIC' and 'LOGISTIC' scoring methods take into account that tracks 
with a lot of genre/style tags don't return so many matches because it's 
almost impossible to match all of them. Therefore a curve is used, giving 
an extra weight to lower matches, specially for high tag values counts (n).

'NORMAL' scoring method just acts like a high-pass filter for scoring,
where the turning point is set at 40%. High tag value counts just make it
smoother. This method considers that similar tracks follow a normal
distribution where the most similar ones will all be over the 40% simil.
critical point.
