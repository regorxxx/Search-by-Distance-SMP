DJ-like playlist creation with key changes following harmonic mixing 
rules... contiguous tracks in the mix are most often either in the same 
key, or their keys are relative or in a subdominant or dominant 
relationship with one another. The primary goal is to create a smooth 
transition between songs, creating an harmonious and consonant mash-up 
with any music genre. 

Uses 9 movements described at 'camelotWheel' on camelot_wheel_xxx.js
The movements creates a 'path' along the track keys, so even changing or 
skipping one movement changes drastically the path.

Therefore, the track selection may change on every execution. Specially if 
there are not tracks on the pool to match all required movements. 
Those unmatched movements will get skipped (lowering the playlist length 
per step), but next movements are relative to the currently selected 
track... so successive calls on a 'small' pool, will give totally different 
playlist lengths. We are not matching only keys, but a 'key path', which 
is stricter.
