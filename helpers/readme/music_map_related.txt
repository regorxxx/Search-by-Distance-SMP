Tracks considered too similar/different by the user  are handled with
special tags which identify these relations.

Source:
--------
Tags are retrieved by TF (can be remapped), by default:
	- 'RELATED'
	- 'UNRELATED'

These tags can contain any mix of any of these values:
	- TITLE
	- ARTIST
	- MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID: is an unique ID associated to a recording,
	so there is no possibility of collisions with tracks with same 
	title or artist but not being the same recording.

Special Tags: (tags and weighting)
-------------
	- Related: if the reference track has any value on this tag, then
	any other track matching by TITLE, ARTIST or MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID
	such values will be considered more similar. The weight is
	configurable. In any case the max score will be 100.
	
	- Unrelated: if the reference track has any value on this tag, then
	any other track matching by TITLE, ARTIST or MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID 
	such values will be considered less similar. The weight is 
	configurable. In any case the min score will be zero.
	
	- This additional score is added/subtracted to the main score 
	calculations, so it's only applied in case the reference track has 
	such tags. OTherwise it's simply skipped. For this reason, there is
	no 'Base score' or 'Scoring method' settings available, since the 
	weight is added as is. For ex. a related track just gets +25 score
	points if matched.
	
	- Setting related tracks weight to 100 will ensure they are always
	shown on the output playlist.
	
	- Setting unrelated tracks weight to -100 will ensure they will
	never be shown on the output playlist.
