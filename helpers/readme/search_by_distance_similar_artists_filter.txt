Filters the library by a query built according to the similar artists of
the reference track. This query is built on-the-fly using the file tags
or JSON database (in both cases they must be computed first).

Note it will always prefer file tags, if present, over any JSON database;
both are never merged. This is done to ensure a possibility to override
the database with a preferred value (tags) if desired. If that's not
desired, just don't use similar artist tags or update them on demand.
