Filters the library by a query built according to the reference track
or theme.

For filtering purposes:
-------------
- Empty queries and 'ALL' are non valid (they do nothing).
- Don't add 2 tags which will be remapped internally by Search by 
Distance tags (see below) in the same query. Use the multiple slots
for that.
- When used along themes, since there is no reference track, the theme
tags are used instead. Note this will probably limit the usage to 
internal remapped tags, since other tags like 'ARTIST' are obviously
missing on the theme. In such case that query is omitted. The tag
may be manually added to the theme though, by editing the theme json.

Rules:
-------------
- Tags are remapped with the current settings for tags. i.e. 'GENRE' 
could be remapped to 'GENRE' and 'ALLMUSIC GENRE' before execution,
if the current genre tag is remapped that way. This is by design, and 
always applied before further processing.
- Dynamic variables are allowed too, enclosed on '#': #ARTIST#, 
#$year(%date%)#, ...
- There are a few special variables, which are not evaluated against
a track but globally. For ex: #YEAR# -> 2023
- These placeholders will be replaced with focused item\'s TF result on 
execution.
- Using tags alone, translates into multivalue tags/queries by default.
- When using TF expressions ($...), tags are not converted and the 
expression is executed 'as is'.
- When using a NOT along a remapped tag, the evaluation will be joined
with an 'AND' instead of 'OR'.
- Standard queries may be added -ONLY- to the end of a dynamic query 
expression. In any other case it will probably throw an error.
- Multiple dynamic multivalued variables are allowed, but they must be 
enclosed on parenthesis to work.
- In any case queries are tested before using it, so errors will be 
shown as a popup.

Special variables:
-------------
Don't require a track to be evaluated (i.e. they always work with
themes):
	- #DAY# 	-> 14 (current day)
	- #MONTH#	-> 11 (current month)
	- #YEAR#	-> 2023 (current year)

Some examples: 
-------------
For a rock track: 
GENRE IS #GENRE# -> GENRE IS Rock.
The entire library would be filtered with tracks from that genre.

If genre tag is remapped (with 2 tags), then it would translate into:
GENRE IS #GENRE# -> (GENRE IS Rock) OR (ALLMUSIC GENRE IS Rock)

For a rock and electronic track, it would translate into:
GENRE IS #GENRE# -> (GENRE IS Rock) AND (GENRE IS Electronic)
Note multi-value tags are split and produce multiple query entries
by default. (*)

If genre tag is also remapped, in such case it would look like:
GENRE IS #GENRE# -> ((GENRE IS Rock) AND (GENRE IS Electronic))
OR ((ALLMUSIC GENRE IS Rock) AND (ALLMUSIC GENRE IS Electronic))

It can also be used to remap tags like this (for a Bob Dylan's track):
COMPOSER IS #ARTIST# -> COMPOSER IS Bob Dylan

Merging standard and dynamic expressions  is also possible, as long as
the standard query expression is added at the end, like:
GENRE IS #GENRE# AND NOT (%RATING% EQUAL 2 OR %RATING% EQUAL 1)
->
(GENRE IS Psychedelic Rock) AND (GENRE IS Hard Rock) AND NOT (%RATING%
EQUAL 2 OR %RATING% EQUAL 1). 

Multiple dynamic queries are also possible. Note how the parenthesis are
used to limit dynamic expansion.
((GENRE IS #GENRE#) OR (STYLE IS #STYLE#)) 
 -> 
(((GENRE IS Psychedelic Rock) AND (GENRE IS Hard Rock)) OR ((STYLE
IS Acid Rock) AND (STYLE IS Live)))

On other cases parenthesis may be redundant (but valid):
((DATE IS #DATE#) OR (DATE IS #$add(%DATE%,1)#))
->
((DATE IS 1969) OR (DATE IS 1970)).
 
Note how single valued tags don't need extra parenthesis since dynamic
expansion does not apply here:
(DATE IS #DATE# OR DATE IS #$add(%DATE%,1)#) 
->
(DATE IS 1969 OR DATE IS 1970) 

Don't forget the rules for internal tag remapping about 'NOT':
GENRE IS #GENRE# -> GENRE IS Rock
NOT GENRE IS #GENRE# -> NOT GENRE IS Rock
With internal tag remapping, the second case uses 'AND' instead of 'OR':
GENRE IS #GENRE# -> (GENRE IS Rock) OR (MYGENRE IS Rock)
NOT GENRE IS #GENRE# -> (NOT GENRE IS Rock) AND (NOT MYGENRE IS Rock)

Common errors:
-------------
Queries don't allow TF expressions after IS/HAS/GREATER/... terms.

For ex:
"$sub(%DATE%,10)" GREATER #DATE# -> "$sub(%DATE%,10)" GREATER 1969
And
%DATE% GREATER #$add(%DATE%,10)# -> %DATE% GREATER 1979
Are equivalent and valid, since both ensure tracks with date > 1979.

But this similar query is non valid (and will throw an error):
%DATE% GREATER "$add(#DATE#,10)" -> %DATE% GREATER "$add(1969,10)"
Since the TF expression is not executed during query evaluation!

Note in these cases there is (usually) no need to add quotes at the
dynamic term when using a function since the final value must be a
string/number, not another function (like the last example).

It is not possible to add 2 tags which are going to be remapped at the
same query slot. For ex:
'NOT GENRE IS #GENRE# AND STYLE IS #STYLE'

(*) Since '#TAG# IS VALUE' forces tag to be equal to value, muti-value 
tags follow the same rationale. If you want to use another logic (OR,
combinations, etc.) between different values of the same tag
then the tool to use would be 'Search Same By'.
