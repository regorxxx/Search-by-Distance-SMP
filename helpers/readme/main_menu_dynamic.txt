An utility to easily set main Spider Monkey Panel menu entries
found at 'File\Spider Monkey Panel\Script Commands\[Panel Name]...'.

Dynamic menus are available with SMP 1.6.1+. They allow to execute 
panel actions via main menus and even associate them to a keyboard
shortcut or native toolbar buttons. Most menu entries has been 
replicated this way. 
 
There is no limit (the old method was limited to 10 entries), 
so it can be used independently to other panels. 

It also allows to control the tools via CMD, allowing
further scripting integrated with the SO or other software.

Every panel has its own set of associated actions, 
so every panel must have different panel names to work 
(usually not a problem for a toolbar panel). 

This utility is also a way to integrate Playlist Tools
with online controllers. Since online controllers like
foo_httpcontrol (https://bitbucket.org/oblikoamorale/foo_httpcontrol/wiki/Home)
can not interact in any way with custom buttons, UI elements 
or SMP scripts, the only way to 'use' some of these scripts is associating
a tool to a main menu entry. 

Having this functionality built-in within Playlist Tools allows not only
setting your own customized scripts but also using all the tools 
found within this utility! In other words, it allows to also use any of the
tools included via remote commands.
