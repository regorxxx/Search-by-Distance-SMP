Creates intelligent "spotify-like" playlists using high-level data from
tracks similar to the currently selected one according to genre, style,
key, etc. When their score is over 'scoreFilter', then they are included
in the final pool. See '_images\search_by_distance_GRAPH_diagram.png'.

GRAPH presets work by linking similar genre\style tags on a graph
(Rock -> Southern Rock -> Country Rock -> Country).
Instead of using tag matching (Rock != Hard Rock) or simple grouping
(Rock group: Rock, Hard Rock, Alt. Rock, ...).
Tags must be included on '.\helpers\music_graph_descriptors_xxx.js' to work.
