Removes tracks with same tags (also real duplicated files) from playlists.
Note you can use these functions to filter lists! i.e. if you only check 
by artist/date, then any track with same artist/date is considered duplicated.
That means this could be used both to find duplicates or for custom 
post-playlist creation filtering (1 track per artist, 1 track per date, etc.)

If 'sortouput = ""', then final order will be randomized. It follows 'plman.SortByFormat' conventions.
Any 'sort...' variable follows titleformat conventions
	i.e. "%title%|%artist%|%date%"
Any 'check...' variable can follow both tag name or titleformat conventions (functions too) 
	i.e. "title" or "%title%"
You can add multiple entries to the same variable but then it must follow titleformat conventions.
	i.e. "checkfirst = %title% - %artist%"
The multiple 'check...' variables are joined using " - " before execution.
