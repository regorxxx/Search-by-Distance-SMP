Creates intelligent "spotify-like" playlists using high-level data from
tracks similar to the currently selected one according to genre, style,
key, etc. When their score is over 'scoreFilter', then they are included
in the final pool.

DYNGENRE presets work by grouping similar genre\style tags (Rock group:
Rock, Hard Rock, Alt. Rock, ...). Instead of using tag matching 
(Rock != Hard Rock) or more complex linking. Tags must be included on
'.\helpers\dyngenre_map_xxx.js' to work.
