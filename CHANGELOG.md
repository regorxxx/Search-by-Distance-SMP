- Harmonic mixing: code for pattern creation moved to camelot_wheel.js.
- Harmonic mixing: code for sending to playlist moved to helpers and reused in multiple scripts.
- Debug: Greatly expanded the debug functions to check possible errors or inconsistencies in the descriptors. It should be foolproof now.
- Descriptors: Multiple fixes on descriptors found with the new debug code.
